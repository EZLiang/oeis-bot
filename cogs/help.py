help_doc = """Welcome to Sequency, Discord's OEIS bot!

There may be a lot of namespaces, but I'll help you around.
`oeis` for OEIS-related stuff
`deis` for DEIS stuff
`discord` can make me send messages, give roles and colors, and more!
`bot` is for configuration and etc

Type `bot:namespaces` for more info
